      title: Eight Queens
      image: /assets/images/chess_board.png
      description: >

        Pretend that the grid below is a chess board. Your job is to place
        eight queens on the board in such a way that no queen can capture any other
        queen. For those who don't play chess, what you need to do is fill in eight of
        the sixty-four squares below so that no two squares are in line with each
        other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
        Once you have found a solution, try to write some code that can 
        tell you how many <i>different</i> possible solutions there are. 
        As a double bonus, how many of those solutions are unique; that is,
        not a rotated or flipped version of another solution.

      title: Shared Birthday
      description: >
        I have a group of 30 friends round for a party. What is the probability
        at least two of them share a birthday? Write the code so that you can also
        given an answer for <i>N</i> friends, where <i>N</i> is between 2 and 50.
