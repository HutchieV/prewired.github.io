      description: >

        Pretend that the grid below is a chess board. Your job is to place
        eight queens on the board in such a way that no queen can capture any other
        queen. For those who don't play chess, what you need to do is fill in eight of
        the sixty-four squares below so that no two squares are in line with each
        other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
        Once you have found a solution, try to write some code that can 
        tell you how many <i>different</i> possible solutions there are. 
        As a double bonus, how many of those solutions are unique; that is,
        not a rotated or flipped version of another solution.
