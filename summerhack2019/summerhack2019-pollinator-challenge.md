The aim of the Edinburgh Pollinator Pledge is to create a network of people and habitats that are supporting pollinators across the city.  What would be the most fun, provocative or interesting way to do either of the following?

1.	Encourage more people to sign up to <www.edinburghpollinatorpledge.org.uk>
2.	Target action to specific areas of the city

## Why are pollinators important?

Insects such as bees, flies, moths, butterflies and beetles are incredibly important in their role as pollinators. We rely on pollination to create Edinburghâ€™s beautiful landscapes and to produce many of the crops we rely on. Our city would not be the same without them and yet their numbers are in decline. 

There are over 160,000 gardens in Edinburgh and these could form part of a massive network to support pollinators. Gardens can be excellent places for pollinators, but the quality varies enormously. Research into urban pollinators shows there are some simple actions anyone with access to a garden or greenspace can take.

## How to do it 

We are looking for a creative and engaging game to inspire more people to sign up and show the progress of the pledge. You might want to think about using a story or the character of a bee to make your game interesting.

There are already 226 people signed up to the pledge and this information is available to you on https://edinburghlivinglandscape.org.uk/pollinatorpledge/ (the downloaded data is also provided). Each point represents a person that has signed the pledge and have created good nodes in the network. 

The bee map provided shows which areas we think are the most suitable for bumble bees. This show the gaps in the network and which areas you could target to get more pledges and complete the network. 

More information on the actions that people can take is available on the website including graphics and images that you can use if you wish to. 

## Sample Code

We have created a [Jupyter notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/prewired/workshops/blob/master/notebooks/swt.ipynb) which illustrates some simple ways to visualise the pollinator pledge data on a map using Python.
