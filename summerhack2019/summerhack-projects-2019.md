## The Bugs

**Green Beans**: A game that uses a restaurant cooking scenario to raise awareness about sustainability and show people how they can reduce greenhouse gas emissions in their everyday lives.
There is also a profit score to make it more realistic and to show how people can protect the environment without damaging their lifestyle.
It is a click-and-drag game, currently with three different meal options and two different upgrades.
