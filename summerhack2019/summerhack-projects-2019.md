<!-- # Challenges

The teams all decided to pick one of the following two challenges:

## Cyber Security Challenge (Civic Digits)

Create a game or an app to help someone who doesn’t know or think about cyber security

* Tell someone something about how to stay safe online
* Encourage them to find out for themselves.
