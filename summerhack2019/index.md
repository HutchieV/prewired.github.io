## Overview

We are excited to announce that we are running **Summer Hack** again this year &mdash; a week-long team programming competition for young people of secondary school age (aged 12 and over).

**Register now**: Please complete this <a href="https://forms.gle/U42MZZs22h3Yx47Q6" target="_blank">registration form</a>  and we will get back to you soon.


The Summer Hack will take place 10:00 am  &ndash; 4:00 pm every day, July 22nd&ndash;26th 2019 at [CodeBase Events Space](https://goo.gl/maps/KD9Gru6wjzr), 38 Castle Terrace, Edinburgh EH3 9SJ. 


* What is involved? You will be working in a small team, collaborating on a small project.
* Will there be prizes? Yes. At the end of the week, each team will give a demo of their project, and prizes will be awarded in various categories.
* Do you need to bring a laptop? Not necessarily &mdash; we can provide one.
* What about food? We will provide snacks but you will need to bring your own lunch.
